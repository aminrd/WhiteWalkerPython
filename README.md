Converting human face into a White Walker!
This is a try to convert a face in images into a White Walker version. If you don't know who are white walkers, check out this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Walker). This program uses OpenCV and Numpy libraries to detect and convert faces.
In order to run this program, replace `face.jpg` with your image and then run: 

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
python WhiteWalker.py
```
Output image will be saved into `output.jpg`.
